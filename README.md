## Big Mart Sales Prediction

Welcome to the Big Mart Sales Prediction project! ðŸ›’ðŸ“ˆ

In this project, I participated in the 'Big Mart Sales Prediction' competition organized by Analytics Vidhya. The goal was to build a predictive model to forecast sales for various products across different stores of Big Mart.

### About the Competition:
The competition provided a professional platform to showcase data science skills, compete with peers, and learn new techniques. Participants had access to real-world data and were encouraged to explore, analyze, and model the dataset to predict sales accurately.

### My Approach:
I utilized exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to understand the data, handle missing values, and engineer features. Then, I experimented with various machine learning algorithms, ultimately selecting RandomForestRegressor for its performance in predicting sales.

### Results:
I'm proud to have achieved a spot in the top 13% of participants, with a rank of 6977 out of 51000 applicants.
Achieved RMSE of 1085.78 on validation set.

### Code and Output:
You can find my code and detailed analysis here. Feel free to explore and provide feedback!
